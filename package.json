  "description": "Welcome to the Bitcoin Border Wallets repo. <br> <br> Border Wallets offer Bitcoiners a way to quickly, easily, and reliably generate, memorise and recall Bitcoin wallet seed words using user-generated patterns or cell co-ordinates combined with randomly shuffled 'grids' of Bitcoin seed words. <br> <br> Border Wallets are a new idea, so if you have not yet familiarised yourself with what they are or how they work with our Seed Grid Generator, please visit our website [BorderWallets.com](https://borderwallets.com) to learn about it. <br> <br> If you have any ideas for how to make this project better and to reach more people, especially in our target demographic, or if you would like to help or contribute to the project, we'd love to hear from you. <br><br> Want to connect?
